### At the forefront of diagnostic technology

Molecular signatures secreted into extracellular space have long been utilized to reveal pathological events in diverse, potentially ill populations. 

As the complexity of intended-to-diagnose diseases increases to multi-genic and multi-organ systems, the ability to acquire more complex and broadly informative extracellular signatures is paramount in the development of equivalent diagnostic approaches: Next Generation Sequecing (NGS) **liquid biopsies**.

Now, at the intersection of contemporary high-throughput NGS and robust machine-learning enabled classification models, liquid biopsies are being developed to sensitively and specifically diagnose diseases in broader at-risk populations.
While the technologies are primed to deliver a new paradigm in diagnostics that reshape prognostic expectations, there are numerous challenges rooted in equitable representation and meaningful inclusion that require consideration.
Among them are those questions that have dogged genomics-enabled genetics research in recent decades:

- *Who is data generated by? Who is data generated for?*  
- *How is data stored and who owns it?*  
- *Who benefits from the analyses and technologies built upon biomedical datasets?*  
- *How are social labels used to contextualize analysis?*  

This article seeks to contextualize the advent of minimally invasive, genetics- and genomics-based diagnostics within the current efforts to make genomics research and clinical development more equitable and inclusive endeavors.
In paricular, much has been made of the bias and danger inherent to proclamations derived from currently limited Human genomes and studies.
Here, the focus will be placed on the noisier, more heterogeneous output of the genome: *Transcription*.
As RNA expression becomes a critical tool in diagnosing disease, considering the intersection of this data-rich event with current challenges to genomic studies is critical to understanding its future role as a clinical diagnostic tool.
